# Basic Backend Developer Interview

**Explanations:**

I decided to create this project using only Node.js and its tools because it's simpler
to use it to solve the entire problem instead of using PHP/Symphony and Node.js at the same time, I also made this decision because MongoDB works well with Node.js.

I also chose to use MongoLab instead of installing
MongoDB, this way the team can test my application
without spending so much time.

**Requirements to run this project:**

- Node v6.11.1
- NPM  v3.10.10
- MongoLab sandbox account (MongoDB as a service)
  - https://mlab.com/plans/pricing/#plan-type=sandbox

> API Directory

**Use these commands inside api directory**

-  $ npm install (install all dependencies)

-  $ npm run test (all tests in default mode)

-  $ npm run test:watch (all tests in watch mode)

-  $ npm run server (run api server)
  - `http://localhost:3000/`


-  $ npm run test:coverage (generate tests coverage)

  - `http://localhost:3000/coverage/lcov-report`


-  $ npm run docs (generate api documentation)

  - `http://localhost:3000/docs` (open to see how to use the API)
